# ZK-Sync-became-the-second-roll-up
   ZK Sync became the second roll-up where active users and their daily transactions reached the Ethereum mainnet!! It hasn't flipped yet, but it's very close. In general, it is good news because the networks will have a good income through hype and use it properly, they will have a more stable token through redemption and refund.
